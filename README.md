Starting point for TP2.

Your first steps should be:
1) Run existing unittest to make sure the initial version is ok.
2) Deploy application in a docker container.
3) run deployment tests to test the initial version.
4) Automate the steps above through various scripts (See TP).
5) Proceed with other tasks from TP (adding features, adding tests, adding scripts and CI, ...)
